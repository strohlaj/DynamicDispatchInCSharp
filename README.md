# DynamicDispatchInCSharp

##Getting Started

exploring two ways to accomplish dynamic dispatch in C# - both of which are lame. In a language such as smalltalk, the dispatching evaluates at runtime based on the derived type of the caller and dispatches accordingly - this is not so in C#, therefore the visitor pattern must be used to accomplish multiple dispatch, or in the case of this project, some wonkiness.
