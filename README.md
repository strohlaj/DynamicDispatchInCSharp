# DynamicDispatchInCSharp

## Getting Started

exploring two ways to accomplish multiple dispatch in C# - both of which are lame. In a language such as smalltalk, the dispatching evaluates at runtime based on all derived types of the abstract types involved and dispatches accordingly - this is not so in C#, therefore the visitor pattern must be used to accomplish multiple dispatch, or in the case of this project, some other wonkiness.
